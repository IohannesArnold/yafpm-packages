# Yafpm packages
This repository contains build scripts for the
[Yafpm Package Manager](https://github.com/IohannesArnold/yafpm).

### Licensing
I am not a lawyer, but to my lay understanding the scripts in this repo are
so simple that there's very little in them that could be copyrightable.
Then again, AT&T once asserted copyright 
[over an empty file](http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/humor/ATT_Copyright_true.html).
So, to the extent that one can have copyright over these scripts, they are
released under the BSD 0 Clause License, which imposes no restrictions or
obligations whatsoever, not even one like the MIT license's requirement to
carry the license text around.

Note however that the terms of the BSD 0 License only apply to the scripts in
this repo. The software that are built are provided under a variety of
different licenses. In the case that a seed binary needs to be included in the
repository, its license file is included in the same directory.
