The order here is a bit tricky, so this README explains.
1) v2-as-ts.toml runs to assemble the stage 2 assembler object file.
2) v2-as.toml runs to turn the object file into an executable using elfify.
3) v2_5-as-ts.toml runs to assemble the stage 3 assembler object file using 2.
4) v2_5-as.toml runs to turn the object file into an executable using elfify.
5) v2_5-ld-ts.toml runs to assemble the stage 3 linker object file using 2.
6) v2_5-ld.toml runs to turn the object file into an executable using elfify.
7) v3-as-o.toml runs to assemble the stage 3 assembler object file using 4.
8) v3-as.toml runs to turn the object file into an executable using 6.
9) v3-ld-ts.toml runs to assemble the stage 3 linker object file using 4.
10) v3-ld.toml runs to turn the object file into an executable using 6.
